# Responsive Portfolio Webpage

## Description

This Responsive Portfolioe Webpage was a project undertaken as the Week 2 Challenge on my Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development.

The motivation was to build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses, showcasing my skills and talents to emplyers. 

Also to set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: grid, flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

The problem solved by this project was the absence of a portfolio page to showcase myself.

Finally, continued use of GitFlow for Git version control, using GitHub to manage the project is always great professional practice.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
When my Responsive Porfolio page is loaded the page presents my handle - PeaFUNK, my avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my skills, some of which open applications (eg. my illustration gallery)
* When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others (Illustration)
* When images of each of My Work areas are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application or to a relevant URL to discover more about this area of my work
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the user's viewport
